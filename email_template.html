    Dear ${name},
</p>


<p>
To all our wonderful family<br/>
And, of course dear friends<br/>
Our hopes are that you'll join us<br/>
For merriment that never ends.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The occasion is purely joyous<br/>
In fact it's truly grand.<br/>
Who thought there'd be a wedding?<br/>
Who knew he'd take her hand.
</p>

<p>
First, we're jetting off to England<br/>
To be married on that enchanting isle.<br/>
Then we're coming home again<br/>
To do it up in style.<br/>
<p>

<p>
We're planning a wedding reception<br/>
With the utmost, greatest care.<br/>
And it's terribly important<br/>
For us that you'll be there.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Please join us in celebrating our wedding on July 30th in Melbourne, FL. You can RSVP via
